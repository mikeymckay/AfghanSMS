  Pashto - pretty much nothing works in pashto
    DTree dies when trying to add a transition between states that have UTF8
      'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd8 in position 54: ordinal not in range(128). You passed in <Transition: [Bad Unicode data]> (<class 'decisiontree.models.Transition'>)
      Request Method:   
    Figure out how to detect a pashto (non UTF8?) character, then set language with this
    Phrases from keyword handlers need translating

Features:
Critical

Non-critical
  SMS: Figure out how to do incremental searching (sending 1 gives the next result)
    name, location, service, last message all implemented with keywordhandler
    probably need to create something more complicated that uses sessions
  Linking to individual reports or custom reports sets (i.e. from searches)
    Will use report tab/template and just make the reports object have the required report
  Limiting search results (currently returns all)
  Need to combine afghansms-extensions with afghansms - no reason for them to be separate
  Hooking up to a gateway
    Can we use textmagic for demo purposes?
